Feature: track university and campus requirements progress

As a college student, after I visit my profile page
So that I can see what courses I need to fulfill my university requirements
I want to be able to click on the University button and be shown a list of courses that fulfill the requirements with a radio button next to each one so I can keep track of my progress.

Background: Courses have been added to database.
